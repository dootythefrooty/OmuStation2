This is a fork from [Goob Station](https://github.com/Goob-Station/Goob-Station), a primary fork from [Space Station 14](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14). To prevent people forking [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox), a "content" pack is loaded by the client and server. This content pack contains everything needed to play the game on one specific server this is the content pack for Omu Station.

Omu Station strives to be a fork focused on more roleplay-centric gameplay while still focusing on community. We intend to take more mechanics from other forks and build a place where everyone can enjoy and play a unique shift every round.

If you want to host or create content for SS14, go to the [Space Station 14 repository](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14) as it contains both RobustToolbox and the content pack for development of new content packs and is the base for your fork.

## Documentation/Wiki

The Goob Station [docs site](https://docs.goobstation.com/) has documentation on GS14's content, engine, game design, and more. It also has lots of resources for new contributors to the project; this website is great for use, and because we are so closely related to Goob Station, we suggest checking them out! They are our upstream and we pull most changes from them.
